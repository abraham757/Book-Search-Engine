# Book Search Engine
## Overview
The Book Search Engine is built using Apollo Server and GraphQL, offering a unique and efficient approach to data handling, moving away from traditional REST API routes. With GraphQL, users can request only the specific data they need, reducing unnecessary data fetching and optimizing overall performance. The core of the application is connected to a MongoDB database, which stores an extensive collection of Google Books. For security and user authentication, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to protect sensitive data and control access to private resources. This combination of modern technologies ensures a reliable, fast, and secure foundation for the book search engine.

## Usage
This project utilizes a powerful tech stack that delivers a smooth and personalized book cataloging experience. Apollo Server serves as the main interface, while MongoDB, managed by Mongoose, handles efficient data storage and retrieval of user-specific book details. In addition, the app integrates with Google Books via a GraphQL API endpoint, enabling users to effortlessly search for and add new books to their custom library. The combination of these technologies results in a user-friendly and powerful platform to curate a digital collection of favorite books.
